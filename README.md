## Introduction

This project builds a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline for a machine learning application implemented with scikit-learn
and Flask. The application provides Boston house price predictions.

Continuous integration is implemented using Github Actions along with a Makefile, requirements.txt and application code to perform an initial lint, test, and install cycle. The project builds an integration with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository
2. Ensure you have all the dependencies
3. Follow the instructions below

## Dependencies

The following are the dependecies of the project you will need:

- Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com)
- Install the following tools:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Project plan

- Spreadsheet with the estimated project plan: [Project Management Spreadsheet](https://github.com/thom/azure-ci-cd-pipeline/blob/main/project-management.xlsx)
- Trello board for task tracking: [Azure CI/CD Pipeline Board](https://trello.com/b/cvzyhixM/azure-ci-cd-pipeline)

## Instructions

### Architectural overview

![Architectural overview](images/architectural-overview.png)

1. The developer pushes the code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions runs the following actions:
   - `make install`
   - `make lint`
   - `make test`
3. Azure Pipelines builds the project
   - Creates virtual Python environment
   - Installs all requirements
   - Runs `make install` and `make lint`
   - Deploys the web app to App Services
4. App Services serves the web app

### Test the web app in Azure Cloud Shell

Open a new Azure Cloud Shell and create new SSH keys to access the GitHub repository:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Copy the contents of the new public key to your GitHub profile in settings:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Fork this repository and adapt the following URL to match the path to your forked repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thom/azure-ci-cd-pipeline.git
```

![git clone](images/git-clone.png)

Change into the new directory:

```bash
cd azure-ci-cd-pipeline
```

Create a virtual Python environment and activate it:

```bash
make setup
source ~/.udacity-devops/bin/activate
```

Install all dependencies in the virtual environment and run tests:

```bash
make all
```

![make all](images/make-all.png)

Run the application in the Azure Cloud Shell environment:

```bash
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```

Open a new Cloud Shell session and make a prediction:

```bash
./make_prediction.sh
```

The output should look like below:

![Prediction](images/prediction-local.png)

### Deploy the web app to Azure App Services

In order to deploy the application to Azure App Service, you can run the following command:

```
az webapp up \
    --resource-group flask-ml-service-rg \
    --name flask-ml-service-ikhono \
    --sku F1 \
    --location eastus \
    --verbose
```

The name must be unique. If you visit the URL, you should see your site deployed:

![Deployed web app](images/deploy.png)

If you want to update your app, make changes to your code and then run:

```
az webapp up \
    --name flask-ml-service-ikhono \
    --verbose
```

### Create Azure DevOps pipeline

Follow [Use CI/CD to deploy a Python web app to Azure App Service on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops) in order to setup the Azure DevOps pipeline for the project.

You need to execute the following steps:

1. Go to [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com/) and sign-in
2. Create a new project
3. Go to project settings and create a new service connection:
   - Select "Azure Resource Manager"
   - Select "Service principal (automatic)" as authentication method
   - Select your subscription and the "flask-ml-service-rg" resource group
   - Make sure to grant access permission to all pipelines
4. Create a new pipeline:
    - Select "GitHub" on the "Connect" tab
    - Chose your repository on the "Select" tab
    - Update the variables

```bash
# Azure Resource Manager connection created during pipeline creation
azureServiceConnectionId: '797b064-faf8-45c8-be58-b627cd632286'

# Web app name
webAppName: 'flask-ml-service-ikhono'

# Environment name
environmentName: 'flask-ml-service-ikhono'
```

Use the following end-point to get your Azure Service Connection ID: [https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/serviceendpoint/endpoints?api-version=5.0-preview.2
](https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/serviceendpoint/endpoints?api-version=5.0-preview.2
) (replace organization and project accordingly).

Successful deployment of the project in Azure Pipelines:

Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment:

### Make a prediction

Run `make_predict_azure_app.sh` to make a prediction:

![Successful prediction](images/prediction-app-service.png)

View your app logs to check the requests:

```bash
az webapp log tail -g flask-ml-service-rg --name flask-ml-service-ikhono
```

![App log](images/app-log.png)

## Clean-up

The easiest way to clean-up all resources created in this project, is to delete the resource group:

```bash
az group delete -n flask-ml-service-rg
```

## Enhancements

The following enhancements could be implemented to improve the project:

- Use Git branches to deploy code into testing/staging environment instead of pushing it to production immediately
- Use Terraform to deploy the infrastructure instead of Azure CLI
- Only use one CI/CD tool instead of using GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines

## Demo

See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V91qf4VZ9vk) for a video demonstrating the project.
